This project mainly focuses on accurately predicting and modeling the energy state of the solar car when driving.

  Subprojects:
    (1) Strategy: Calculates and plots energy and power of car versus velocity.
    
    (2) Weather_data: Obtains weather data from wunderground.com API and creates an array. Will be integrated with Strategy.ipynb.
