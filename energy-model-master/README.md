This is the Strategy Project for UC Berkeley's Solar Car Team. 

  Current Terms: Fall 2016, Spring 2017

  Contributors: Matthew Turney, Neha Kunjal, Sarah Sun, Elaine Chien, Jason Lum, Andrew Kim

This project mainly focuses on accurately predicting and modeling the energy state of the solar car when driving.

  Subprojects:
    (1) Strategy: Calculates and plots energy and power of car versus velocity.
    
    (2) Weather_data: Obtains weather data from wunderground.com API and creates an array. Will be integrated with Strategy.ipynb.
    
    (3) TODO: Current project: FSGP updates -> working on function to calculate optimal average speed given race parameters
